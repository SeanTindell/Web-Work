                            <p>  I love to learn, and when I found coding... I found something for me. Coding, Web Development, and Engineering have all fascinated me since I first discovered it. Since then, I have been constantly learning all I can. I studied at Trident Technical College to get a solid foundation in computer programming and development. Eventually earning my Associate's Degree in Applied Sciences, with a focus on Computer Programming.</br></br>
I love a challenge and am quick to find solutions to problems I find. Currently I am working on increasing my knowledge of coding by going through Free Code Camp, and using Code Fights to keep my coding skills sharp and efficient. When I code I tend to find myself losing time getting sucked into the code getting everything together. There is something about putting a project together and having it all come together and working. I just love that.</br></br>
Before all of this, I graduated from Full Sail University with a Bachelor's Degree in Videogame Art. I loved working those 2 years in the industry, but I feel like working in Web Development is the best fit for me now. Thanks to my time in the industry I now have a strong eye for design.  My past experiences, including Trident Tech and Full Sail University, have lead me to a bright future on this path. If you're reading this, I hope that you will consider me as a good fit for your organization
