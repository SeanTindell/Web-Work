# Web-Work 

This is my web developer designer portfolio.
It is currently a work in progress as I build out my portfolio, 
but I plan to use this to show design, coding, and full stack developer skills.

This is a sudoku solver that can take a sudoku puzzle and solve it for you. At the moment it only has a single puzzle but after testing multiple puzzles inside the code I was able to find thatit works with most if not all puzzles.
